# Machine Learning Project - Regression

This side project demonstrates machine learning concepts and data preprocessing, ordinal and nominal encoding. The objective is to predict the housing price based on certain factors like house area, bedrooms, furnished, nearness to mainroad, etc. Each of the four models' parameters is hyper-tuned to optimize the R square score. The following are the models used to train the model (Model 1 to 4 respectively): 

>- Mult-Linear Regression
>- Decision Tree Regression
>- Random Forest Regression
>- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project is shows useful insight in terms of different variables when predicting housing prices. When hyper-tuning parameters on each model, it shows a complexity arises due to the noticeable strong multicollinearity. For default, an 80:20 split is used when splitting the dataset into training and test sets. To improve performance, the mult-linear regression model was also tested on a 70:30 split.
